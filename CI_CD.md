# Background with CI/CD

My background with CI and CD is not very robust. I have mutation testing experience from CS3114 here, where part of each assignment is to pass a basic amount of mutation testing in order to get credit in WebCat. I have also done client-side application development, but since this was not a live site, I did not get experience working with CI/CD. I did do some version control using Github, but that's about it. I do have experience with dark launching through observation, not direct implementation, of it.
